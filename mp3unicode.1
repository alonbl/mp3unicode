.Nm mp3unicode
.Nd Convert MP3 tags to Unicode
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm mp3unicode
MP3Unicode is a command line utility to convert ID3 tags in mp3 files between
different encodings.
.Pp
In order to see vailable encodings execute:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ iconv --list
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width "AA"
.It --source-encoding Ar <encoding>
Read current mp3 tags assuming they are encoded with <encoding>.
<encoding> is either "unicode" or any valid 8bit encoding.
.It --id3v1-encoding Ar <encoding>
Write id3v1 tag in <encoding>, if <encoding> is "none", then strip id3v1
tag away. <encoding> may be any valid 8bit encoding, note however that it
is not possible to write id3v1 in Unicode.
.It --id3v2-encoding Ar <encoding>
Write id3v2 tag in <encoding>, if <encoding> is "none", then strip id3v2
tag away. <encoding> may be either "unicode" or any valid 8bit encoding.
.It --preserve-unicode
If source encoding is specified to be some specific encoding and not Unicode,
but the actual encoding seems to be Unicode, then assume it is Unicode. E.g.,
if you want to process a lot of files, some of which are in Unicode (or have
Unicode characters somewhere), but some are in , just issue -s CP1251 -p along
with other options. This should work as you would like it to work.
