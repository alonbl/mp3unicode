MP3Unicode

I. Introduction

MP3Unicode is a command line utility to convert ID3 tags in mp3 files between
different encodings. For example,

mp3unicode --source-encoding CP1255 --id3v1-encoding none --id3v2-encoding unicode file.mp3

Will read id3v2 tag (or id3v1 tag if there is no id3v2) from the file, convert
the text fields in the tag from  to Unicode and will write id3v2 tag back,
stripping away id3v1 tag.

Andrey wrote it for him-self, since he is now on Linux with utf8, but I have an old mp3
player, which I like but it likes id3v1 tags in  :)

II. Usage

mp3unicode [options] [filename]

Options:

-s, --source-encoding <encoding>
	Read current mp3 tags assuming they are encoded with <encoding>.
	<encoding> is either "unicode" or any valid 8bit encoding.

-1, --id3v1-encoding <encoding>
	Write id3v1 tag in <encoding>, if <encoding> is "none", then strip id3v1
	tag away. <encoding> may be any valid 8bit encoding, note however that it
	is not possible to write id3v1 in Unicode.

-2, --id3v2-encoding <encoding>
	Write id3v2 tag in <encoding>, if <encoding> is "none", then strip id3v2
	tag away. <encoding> may be either "unicode" or any valid 8bit encoding.

-p, --preserve-unicode
	If source encoding is specified to be some specific encoding and not Unicode,
	but the actual encoding seems to be Unicode, then assume it is Unicode. E.g.,
	if you want to process a lot of files, some of which are in Unicode (or have
	Unicode characters somewhere), but some are in , just issue -s CP1251 -p along
	with other options. This should work as you would like it to work.

-v, --version
	Prints version number, compilation date and time.
